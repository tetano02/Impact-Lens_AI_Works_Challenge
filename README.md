# Impact Lens — Professional DNA Diagnostics

**Impact Lens** is an AI-native anti-portfolio.

It doesn’t ask you *what have you done*.
It asks you **who you are** and predicts **what happens when you work with someone**.

In a world where AI has always existed, roles, timelines, and CVs are weak signals.
What matters is **behavioral impact over time**.

## 🧠 What It Does

Impact Lens generates a **diagnostic report** that answers one question:

> **“What reliably happens when this person enters a system?”**

Instead of listing experience, it analyzes:

* decisions
* recurring conflicts
* failures and regrets
* strong preferences
* non-negotiable boundaries
* real work artifacts

The output is not a presentation.
It’s a **prediction of systemic effects**.

## 🧬 Professional DNA (Not a CV)

The tool assumes AI has **continuously observed** the person over time.

Input is collected through multiple sections, each representing a different signal:

* Identity (minimal metadata)
* Key Decisions
* Friction Points
* Anti-Portfolio (what not to repeat)
* Personal Working Manual
* Boundaries
* Context
* Artifacts (links, docs, repos)

The AI synthesizes these fragmented signals into a **longitudinal memory**, then produces a diagnostic snapshot.

## 🎯 Reader-Adaptive Output

The same diagnosis is rendered differently depending on **who is reading**:

* Founder → leverage, speed, risk
* Recruiter → signals, red flags, fit
* Team → collaboration and conflict style
* Client → communication and delivery risk
* Self → blind spots and constraints

Facts stay the same.
The **lens changes**.

---

## 🧠 Why This Is AI-Native

Impact Lens doesn’t “use AI to write better text”.

AI is used as:

* a **memory synthesizer**
* a **pattern detector**
* a **diagnostic engine**

This format only makes sense in a world where AI is always present.

**Impact Lens is not a better portfolio.
It’s a different category.**
